# E-commerce Sales Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales performance of an e-commerce platform using transactional data. The dashboard provides insights into revenue, profit, quantity sold, customer behavior, and payment preferences to support business decision-making.

This was one of my initial Power BI projects and helped me understand core BI concepts such as KPIs, categorization, and interactive analysis.
